# Password Manager

This program manages passwords saved in a `passwords.json` or `passwords.csv` file.

It can generate simple and complex passwords and save them to a `passwords.json` file, and also allows the addition or removal of external passwords.

If your passwords saved in a `passwords.csv` file, the last version of the system converts to `passwords.json` automatically.

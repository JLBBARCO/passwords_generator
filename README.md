# Password Manager

This program manages passwords saved in a `passwords.json` or `passwords.csv` file.

It can generate simple and complex passwords and save them to a `passwords.json` file if it doesn't exist. Otherwise, the passwords will be saved to an existing file, either `passwords.json` or `passwords.csv`, and also allows the addition or removal of external passwords.
